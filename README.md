# Parkinsons-Disease-Prediction-ML
Machine learning pipeline for predicting Parkinson’s disease from biomedical features. Patient records are aggregated, cleaned, and reduced using correlation filtering and chi-square selection. Class imbalance is handled, and Logistic Regression, XGBoost, and SVM are evaluated using ROC-AUC and classification metrics.
